# ParkourMicro
Parkour course used to demo a basic time trial system


<b>Purpose</b>
This is a single parkour course used to create a basic time trial system onto. 

It features two blocks that open and close on a global cycle which can be bothersome. It stores your fastest time on the local play session (not between runs).

It also features some cartoonish water graphics in two pools which was fun to create.

<b>Usage</b>
Feel free to download the project and give the game a try!
The code can be looked at and improved upon, you can add to it if you want. If you do just let me know because I think that would be pretty awesome!
